Not all contributors commit on GitHub. We have many biologists, data analysts and other great people participating in the project. We added Contributors page to Open Genes website to mention them https://open-genes.com/contributors

## About

Open Genes is a non-commercial public service for biologists â€” a biological database of human genes associated with aging and lifespan. 
Open Genes provides open and structured data collected for genes associated with aging. We give researchers in the field of aging genetics 
efficient tools for analyzing gene functions, evolution, the influence of gene activity on lifespan, age-related changes in gene expression, 
methylation and protein activity, associations of allelic variants of genes with longevity and age-related phenotype, processes the gene product 
involved in, bound with hallmarks of aging, associated diseases and much more. And most importantly, we collect and structure experimental data 
that cannot be found in other databases. [Read more](https://open-genes.com/about/articles/what-is-open-genes)
